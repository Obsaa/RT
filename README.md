# Raytracer Project for RT @42

### Program Requirements && Running Exec

To be able to build and run this program you'll need a macbook, because I didn't make it portable for other systems. As for software Requirements, you'll need in order to compile:

* No specific versions. [Unless you are using a version llvm that shows error using -Werror at compile time, take or add those flags out of the makefile. 
* GNU make
* GCC

1. Clone the repo.
2. Access the main folder with makefile.
3. Run Make
4. Run ./RT scenes/scene[*number*].rt
